## Name
Dots, Boxes, Servers and Clients

## Description
This project focuses on implementing the Dots and Boxes game and enabling the user to play it on a server with other users. 
Features: 
- Offline, local gameplay of the Dots and Boxes game 
- Using a client to log into and play on the server
- Listing other clients who are online on the server
- Playing simultaneously more games on the server
- Playing as a native or a smart AI offline and on server as well

## Installation
Download this zip file, containing every element of the project. You will need an application that can run JAVA to run the project. Run either the TUI or the Server and then the ClientTUI to play the game.

## Usage
When running the game locally, through the DotsAndBoxesTUI class. You need to type in the name of the two players and afterwards a game will automatically start.

When using the server/client approach, run the Server class and type in a port for the server to run on. Afterwards, run the ClientTUI class and connect to the server by typing in "localhost" for the address and then for the port, the port number you gave the server. You can now log in with your username on the ClientTUI. If the login is successful you can see the menu helping you what messages you can send the server.
